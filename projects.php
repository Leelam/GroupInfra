              <div>New Delhi : The environment ministry‘s 2012 guidelines for high-rise buildings
that link a building‘s height with the width of the road on which it is located — and
had been strongly opposed by state governments — has failed to get the backing of
a review committee set up by the ministry.

The committee headed by Planning Commission member Dr K Kasturirangan has
recommended that issues relating to urban planning, fire fighting and disaster
management should be left to state governments and local bodies instead.</div>
