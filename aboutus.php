              <div>The issue regarding securitization of future cash-flow in BOT (Toll) projects was discussed in the 94th Board Meetng of the Authority held on 14/05/2013. With a view to ameliorate the shortage of equity and improve liquidity of the prospective bidders, Board approved the proposal for granting permission by NHAI to the Concessionaires of BOT(Toll) projects, which have Toll revenues significantly surplus to the repayment obligations, to raise subordinate loan on the strength of future surplus cash flows of their operational BOT road projects subject to the following conditions:</div>
            </div>
            <div>
<br>
              <div>(A) Raising of subordinate loan upto 30% of TPC of NHAI would be allowed only after COD of the project is achieved in case of 4-laning projects and construction is completed in case of 6 laning Projects.</div>
            </div>
            <div>
    <br>          
              <div>(B) Repayment of such loan would be the last priority under the waterfall mechanism of the Escrow Agreement. It would be allowed only after meeting all kinds of statutory levies/ taxes, O&M expenses, concession fee, damages and other dues of the Authority and Debt Service along with interset due</div>
